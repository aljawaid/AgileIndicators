# AgileIndicators

#### _Plugin for [Kanboard](https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard "Kanboard - Kanban Project Management Software")_

AgileIndicators for Kanboard display the measurements for Task Priorities and Task Complexities in an easy to use general format. Task Priorities are scaled between P1 and P5 whilst Task Complexities are scored as 0-50.


Features
-------------

- Task Priorities Scale
Display priorities between P1 and P5 with general rules for each priority. Use this scale to improve the way you sort and categorise your tasks following a general pattern.
- Task Complexities Scale
Display complexities in groups of ten from 0 to 50. This scale will help those with more complex tasks to define their work and scoring following a general ruleset.
- Both scales show in the interface dashboard and the task page sidebars.
